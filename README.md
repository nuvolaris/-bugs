# Installation Bug Bounty

Hi all! [Nuvolaris Community 3](https://nuvolaris.github.io) is available in preview.

The installer passes [all the tests](https://github.com/nuvolaris/nuvolaris-testing/actions) in our supported platforms and the installation documentation is complete.

So it is time to try to install it.

## Installation successful?

If your installation is successful, report it in our forum and [join us at the *Install Party*](https://nuvolaris.discourse.group/t/install-nuvolaris-and-join-us-at-the-install-party/74)!

We are organizing an Install Party live, and will invite all those who reported a successful installation [in our forum](https://nuvolaris.discourse.group/)!

## Installation fails???

If your installation fails, please file a book, and we will thank you.

We have 10 copies of our book Learning Apache OpenWhisk, the serverless engine that is the foundation of Nuvolaris.

I will make a gift of the book to whose will give us significant help in fixing the bugs.
